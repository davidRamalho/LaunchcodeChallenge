# OPIsystems Take Home Test

This test actually ended up being a lot of fun. If I had more time I would have liked to add some unit testing and to also make the front-end design more responsive and less broken. I also would have expanded the database to include users and allow for user login and logout. In addition I would have added constraints/validation to input data in order to reduce bugs. 

# Running the Application

Run "npm install" on the both the backend and frontend directories, then follow the steps below for the backend and frontend servers.

Backend Server:
Run the backend server first by opening the directory LaunchcodeChallenge/backend/ on your terminal of choice and running: 
"node server.js"

To run the frontend server first open the directory LaunchcodeChallenge/frontend/ on your terminal of choice and run:
"npm start"

# Wireframe Planning

While planning the frontend for this application I used moqups.com in order to have a clear plan of approach. Link: https://app.moqups.com/hVsFCVbeXS/view/page/ad64222d5
